title: Migrating to Doom Emacs

I tried out the [Spacemacs] distribution one year ago, but it wasn't
quite to my liking. One day it failed to start, and I stopped using it.
Several months ago, I heard [Doom Emacs] and had a try. But I continued
to use my vanilla Emacs because I use the native Emacs key bindings, and
customizing Emacs can be an entertainment activity.

Yesterday, I was struggling with how to fix the [graphical glitches] on
Emacs 26. After googling for hours, I found that I only have two
options:

1.  Always using Emacs in a Terminal because the issue only exists in
    GUI.
2.  Waiting for [Emacs For Mac OS X] to release Emacs 27 because the
    the issue has been partially fixed in 27, but the build has other
    problems.

It is frustrating. I decided to give Doom Emacs another try. Turn out,
Doom Emacs is so great that I can't go back. In the following week, I
migrated all my editing workflow to Doom Emacs. Now it is my primary
tool for editing code, taking notes, planning projects, and writing blog
posts.

Using Doom has brought me these benefits:

1.  It starts up [really quickly].
2.  It gets every little thing right. So I'm able to focus on
    customizing the things, I really care about, like my [Zettelkasten]
    workflow.
3.  I use Vim occasionally, so I feel so much more comfortable with its
    key-bindings.
4.  Configuration gets simplified because it provides most of the
    functions I need.

Anyway, like Jon Sander's (jcs) says in his blog post [Migrating from
Emacs to Doom], trying Doom may be more advantageous than wasting your
time on one of those other editors. I believe the term "other editors."
should also include vanilla Emacs if you're not an expert Emacs person.
