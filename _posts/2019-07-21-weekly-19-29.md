Fire and Motion

> The principle of Fire and Motion is how you get things done in life. You have to move forward a little bit, every day. It doesn’t matter if your code is lame and buggy and nobody wants it. If you are moving forward, writing code and fixing bugs constantly, time is on your side. Watch out when your competition fires at you. Do they just want to force you to keep busy reacting to their volleys, so you can’t move forward? Fire and Motion, for small companies like mine, means two things. You have to have [time on your side](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000056.html), and you have to move forward every day. [^1]

异化

异化，是指原本自然互属或和谐的两物彼此分离、甚至互相对立。[^2] 简单解释就是，主体在实践过程中创造出客体，最终客体反过来压迫主体。比如，我们为了更高效得编写软件而创造了多种编程语言，最后被编程语言所压迫，成为编程语言争论中的一员。而原始的目的，更高效得编写软件，已经被忽略了。
