title: Week 16, 2020 - Optimized for Change, Not Clean
---

From Dan Abramov's article [Goodbye, Clean Code](https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/), I learned that:

> Obsessing with “clean code” and removing duplication is a phase many of us go through. 

The reason we do this is we don’t feel confident in our code. We are looking for something that can be measured. Like a set of lint rules, a naming schema, a file structure. I was comparing approaches to organizing files in a Flask project. Dan's perspective inspired me. Visual code clean shouldn't be the goal.
