Why TDD? I think I found the best answer in Eric Elliott's article [TDD Changed My Life](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/tdd-changed-my-life-5af0ce099f80):

> TDD eradicates fear of change.

According to researches using TDD can improve test coverage[^1], which leads to 40%-80% fewer bugs[^2] in production.

TDD has a learning curve, and while you're climbing that learning curve, it can and frequently does add 15%-35% to implementation times[^3]. But eventually you start coding faster with unit tests than you ever did without them.
