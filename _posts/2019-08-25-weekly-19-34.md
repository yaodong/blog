Structured Procrastination

> Procrastinators often follow exactly the wrong tack. They try to minimize their commitments, assuming that if they have only a few things to do, they will quit procrastinating and get them done. But this goes contrary to the basic nature of the procrastinator and destroys his most important source of motivation. The few tasks on his list will be by definition the most important, and the only way to avoid doing them will be to do nothing. This is a way to become a couch potato, not an effective human being.

This is very interesting. I like the "Today" filter in Things because it provides a way to list "a few" things I need to do today. But the most productive time is when I using the massive inboxes.

Why complexity sells

> The sore truth is that complexity sells better, because
>
> 1. Simplicity feels like an easy walk. Complexity feels like mental CrossFit.
> 2. Length is often the only thing that can signal effort and thoughtfulness.
> 3. Things you donâ€™t understand create a mystique around people who do.
> 4. Complexity gives a comforting impression of control, while simplicity is hard to distinguish from cluelessness.

So sad.
