Being Bored

> Seeking relief from pain, the organism moves toward stimulus. But since there is no particular desire to approve or make active as against any other, the self falls into a hopeless struggle with itself that cannot resolve, because there is no evident raw material on which to apply the energy of resolution. Boredom is, at its simplest, a form of desire turned back upon itself, resulting in the inability to act in any purposeful or happy manner.[^1]

Fear, Uncertainty, & Doubt

FUD 最早是指 IBM 的一个销售策略，通过对客户灌输竞争产品的负面观点，在顾客头脑中注入疑惑与害怕，使顾客误以为除了该公司的产品外，他们别无其它选择。[^2]

对于开发者，随时都能听到符合 FUD 策略的言论。比如，C++ 的复杂性，Java 的语法繁琐，Python 的 GIL 对性能的影响，PostgreSQL 的小众。几乎搜索任何技术都能找到类似的争吵。

Not One Bit Simpler

> The quote often attributed to Einstein is “everything must be made as simple as possible, but not one bit simpler.” I think the trouble was that Ive often ignored the second part of that advice in the pursuit of refinement.[^3]
