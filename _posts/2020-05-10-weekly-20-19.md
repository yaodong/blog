title: Week 19, 2020 - One Year
---

Every day I am exposed to a massive amount of information. Since [one year ago](https://untitled.blog/weekly-19-17/), I've been sharing one or two of them to this blog weekly.

I still find it hard to believe I've been doing it for a year. The knowledge I've learned over the past year has completely changed how I process information and think. I started making my Zettelkasten tool. So the records will go there. To here, I'd like to share some summaries and experiences.

Some articles I'd like to share this week:

1. [Keybindings strategies in Emacs](https://sam217pa.github.io/2016/09/23/keybindings-strategies-in-emacs/) by Samuel Barreto.
2. [Do Things that Don't Scale](http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html) by Paul Graham.
3. [Why Auto Increment Is A Terrible Idea](https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/engineering/2015/05/20/why-auto-increment-is-a-terrible-idea/) by Cl√©ment Delafargue.
4. [4 Types of Mindsets](http://corbinlang.weebly.com/blog/4-types-of-mindsets) by Corbin Lang.
