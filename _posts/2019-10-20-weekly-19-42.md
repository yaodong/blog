> In most politically dicey situations, Cook has followed Roosevelt’s advice and picked engagement. While Cook has become more comfortable talking about the ideals that guide Apple’s culture such as environmental responsibility, privacy, and equality, he doesn’t weaponize them to issue ultimatums to foreign governments. Instead, Cook uses his position as CEO to explain to the world which ideals guide Apple employees and the company’s mission to create tools for people. [^1]
