title: Week 15, 2020 - The Tail End
---

Life is short. Both Paul Graham[^1] and Tim Urban[^2] use some simple numbers to describe this fact.

> I read about five books a year, so even though it feels like I’ll read an endless number of books in the future, I actually have to choose only 300 of all the books out there to read and accept that I’ll sign off for eternity without knowing what goes on in all the rest.

Their points can be summarized simply as:

1. relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have.
2. people you love, priorities, and quality time matters.

In addition, Paul gaves insights on how to distinguish stuff that matters: just ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future. The things that matter aren't necessarily that "important".
