The Broken Chain Problem

>  When you want to gather information, make sure that the thing you want to know about is causally connected to the thing you’re looking at directly. When you want to influence the world around you, make sure that your action is causally connected to whatever you want to influence. If the causal chain is broken, don’t pull it.[^1]

Again, ask "why?" five times to the problem before finding a solution.

Goodhart’s Law

>  When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

Writing tests because of lazy

> Writing tests is not a matter of self-discipline or anything like that. To the contrary, the driving force is something more like laziness. I’m taking the easier, faster, more enjoyable path instead of the harder, slower, more miserable one.[^2]

So true.
