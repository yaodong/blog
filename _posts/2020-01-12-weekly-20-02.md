> ##### Embrace Boredom
>
> The nice thing about boringness (so constrained) is that the capabilities of these things are well understood. But more importantly, their failure modes are well understood. 
>
> ##### Optimize Globally
>
> The problem with “best tool for the job” thinking is that it takes a myopic view of the words “best” and “job.” Your job is keeping the company in business, god damn it. And the “best” tool is the one that occupies the “least worst” position for as many of your problems as possible.

> ##### Choose New Technology, Sometimes
>
> New tech eventually has company-wide effects, so adding tech is a decision that requires company-wide visibility.
>
> ##### Just Ship
>
> Mindful choice of technology gives engineering minds real freedom: the freedom to contemplate bigger questions. Technology for its own sake is snake oil.
