title: Week 5, 2020 - Timeboxing
---

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing):

> In time management, timeboxing allocates a fixed time period, called a timebox, within which planned activity takes place. It is employed by several project management approaches and for personal time management. 

I learned Timeboxing from [Marc Zao-Sanders](https://hbr.org/search?term=marc zao-sanders) 's article[^1]. He believe that To-Do lists don't work[^2] because:

> - First, they overwhelm us with too many choices.
> - Second, we are naturally drawn to simpler tasks which are more easily accomplished. 
> - Third, we are rarely drawn to important-but-not-urgent tasks, like setting aside time for learning. 
> - Fourth, to-do lists on their own lack the essential context of what time you have available. 
> - Fifth, they lack a commitment device, to keep us honest.

Here are an article I find useful to implement your own timeboxing strategy.

At last, an interesting piece:

> [Parkinson’s law](https://www.economist.com/news/1955/11/19/parkinsons-law) flippantly states that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.
>
> A corollary of this observation in practice is that we often spend more time on a task than we should, influenced by the time that happens to be available (circumstantial) rather than how long the work should really take (objective).
