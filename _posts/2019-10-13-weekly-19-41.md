From Jorge Manrubia: keeping your dependencies to a minimum is a safe bet [^1]

> Often, when a library covers your needs, it seems that using it is a no-brainer. Again, make sure you are not ignoring the tradeoffs. In many cases, you only need a fraction of what the library does, so you might prefer something simpler, leaner and better tailored to your needs.

Partially agree.. but totally agree with this one

> Make sure you understand the tradeoffs of your picks.
