title: Week 9, 2020 - Dogma
---

From Bret Victor's talk [The Future of Programming](http://worrydream.com/dbx/):

> The most dangerous thought you could have as a creative person is to think that you know what you're doing.

Once you **think** you know what you're doing, you stop looking around for other ways of doing things, and become blind so that you totally miss out on some much more powerful ways of thinking.

If the next generation programmers grow up only being shown one way of thinking about programming. So they work on that way programming, they flesh out all the details, solve that particular model programming, figured it all out. Then, they teach that the next generation so that second generation then grows up thinking they know what programming is beucase it's all been figured out.

They grow up with dogma. Once you grow up with dogma, it's really hard to break out of it.
