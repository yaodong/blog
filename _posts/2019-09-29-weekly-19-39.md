Product-Minded.

> Once you have the product foundations, you need devs who engage with the 'why', actively. Engineers who have the thirst for using technologies to leapfrog human/user problems. Those with empathy to reach for magical experiences. That is what defined a product engineer in my books. Bad ones cut too many corners. **Great product engineers know that minimum lovable products need the right depth** to be considered during the build phase.[^1]

Great advice is actionable advice. Strongly recommended to read.
