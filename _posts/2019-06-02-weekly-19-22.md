在柏林

> 这篇以欧洲为名的文章里，一页分给了法国讲述他们的议院选举，一页给了罗马尼亚讲述国王的政变，整整四页之多都在讲述斯大林爬上权利顶峰的历史，只有最后两页，在讲述西班牙局势时，闪过了未来法国真正的大敌。一张摄于拿坡里，说的是意大利国王正在检阅刚从西班牙归来的军队。另一张则更小一些，在上面，我终于发现那个熟悉的背影：希特勒站在演讲台上，左边是一排迎风飘扬的万字旗，下方则是黑压压的军队，他们的队伍整齐异常。

> 照片旁边，只有轻描淡写的几个字：在柏林。[^1]

which region is part of which

> The list prioritizes how users identifies themselves as "from a certain region". Historically and culturally, people living in Hong Kong and Taiwan first identify themselves as "from Hong Kong" or "from Taiwan". If the listing makes it easier for users to find their respective locations then that's the way it will be listed. This is unrelated to "which region is part of which".[^3]

The XY problem

> - User wants to do X.
> - User doesn't know how to do X, but thinks they can fumble their way to a solution if they can just manage to do Y.
> - User doesn't know how to do Y either.
> - User asks for help with Y.
> - Others try to help user with Y, but are confused because Y seems like a strange problem to want to solve.
> - After much interaction and wasted time, it finally becomes clear that the user really wants help with X, and that Y wasn't even a suitable solution for X.[^4]
