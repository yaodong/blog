title: Week 18, 2020 - The Three Forms of Conversations
---

Daniel Gross summarized communication into three forms in his article [Communication in World 2.0](https://dcgross.com/communication-in-world-20):

**Goal-oriented Conversations**. This modality is durable but impermeable. We’re also less likely to meet new people and create new goals through these contacts. Just repeat interactions with similar characters.

**Novelty Conversations**. This modality is not durable, but is very porous. The world is low on this style of interaction now. Cross-industry relationships are less likely to form.

**Serendipitous Conversations**. You didn’t plan this in advance, but you signaled to the world by your physical location that you were available for conversation. This is another form of interaction we’re lacking right now.
