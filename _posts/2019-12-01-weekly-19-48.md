title: Week 48, 2019 - Relentlessly Resourceful
---

Paul Graham 在 2009 年的一篇文章[^1]里写道：

> I finally got being a good startup founder down to two words: relentlessly resourceful.

在此之前，他一直用 “不要陷于无助（Don't be hapless）” 来表达这种品质。
无助在这里意味着被动。陷于无助意味着被环境所胁制，服从规则而不是改造世界。

为什么 Paul Graham 选择这两个词？先看一下这两个词的解释：

> **Relentless**: continuing in a determined way without any interruption.
> **Resourceful**: able to find and use different ways to help achieve your goals.

我不知道如何翻译 relentless resourceful。但是，仅仅是 continuing 不能够称作为 relentless。
同样地，仅仅是 achieve goals 不能够被称作 resourceful。

Relentless resourceful 表达的是一种不可阻挡的坚持不懈，是一种能够找到并尝试不同方法去解决问题的能力。

下面是从这篇文摘取的一段：

> In any interesting domain, the difficulties will be novel. Which means 
> you can't simply plow through them, because you don't know initially 
> how hard they are; you don't know whether you're about to plow through 
> a block of foam or granite. So you have to be resourceful. 
> You have to keep trying new things.

Another interesting piece I found is an email[^2] written by Linus in 2000:

> I happen to believe that not having a kernel debugger forces people to
> think about their problem on a different level than with a debugger. I
> think that without a debugger, you don't get into that mindset where you
> know how it behaves, and then you fix it from there. Without a debugger,
> you tend to think about problems another way. You want to understand
> things on a different _level_.
