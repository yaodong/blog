> I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it.  -- Nelson Mandela

From Adam Julian Goldstein's [The Anxiety Algorithm](https://www.adamjuliangoldstein.com/blog/anxiety-algorithm/):

**Why everyone has some anxiety?**

The ability to imagine future scenarios has provided a major survival advantage.
You don't have to try risky things to learn whether they're actually dangerous.
Your brain can simply watch hypothetical scenarios like movies and learn lessions from watching. This mechanism us safer, so all of us feel anxious sometimes.

**Why founders are especially prone to anxiety?**

Becuase they're in the business of imagining things that have never been done. The very imaginativeness that enables them to see new opportunities also reveals pats to failure that other don't notice. Seeing these futures can be a blessing (creativity) or a curse (anxiety).

**How to calming Anxiety?**

1. Developing a habit of recognizing thoughts as distinct from reality has been shown.
2. Create routines that reduce the need to decide on minutiae.
3. Make a list of your mediocre personal and professional relationships, and prioritize either improving them or ending them.
4. Setting expectations differently, the default is failure.

> Don't panic. -- Douglas Adams
