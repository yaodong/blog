Write it down

> Everyone gets struck by inspiration at various times during the day. Get in the habit of writing down every random potential idea (sometimes not even a full idea, but an *exploration*: write down a sentence that'll inspire you to think of the full idea). Make sure the path from thinking of the idea to memorializing it in an easily accessible way is as frictionless as possible. [^1]

I have adopted this method for about half year, and it really helps.
