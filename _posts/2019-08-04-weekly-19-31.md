The Problem with Educational Policy

> The problem with educational policy is that it is hardly influenced by scientific considerations derived from the topics taught, and almost entirely determined by extra-scientific circumstances such as the combined expectations of the students, their parents and their future employers, and the prevailing view of the role of the university: is the stress on training its graduates for today's entry-level jobs or to providing its alumni with the intellectual bagage and attitudes that will last them another 50 years?  -- Dr. Edsger W. Dijkstra 1988 [^1]

A 3x5 index card

> Each night before you go to bed, prepare a 3x5 index card with a short list of 3 to 5 things that you will do the next day. Use the back of the 3x5 card as your Anti-Todo List to record what you have done in that day.  -- Marc Andreessen [^2]
